== notmuch vim ruby ==

This is a plug-in that a fully usable mail client through vim, as a plug-in,
utilizing the notmuch framework, through it's ruby bindings.

It aims to provide a familiar experience for the people already using the
existing vim plug-in in notmuch source repository, but with more features.

== features ==

 * Most of the basic features of the current plug-in
 * Gradual searches; you don't have to wait for the whole search to finish,
   sort of like the 'less' command
 * Proper multi-part handling; finds out if there's text/plain, or if
   text/html, converts it using elinks.
 * Extract all attachments
 * Open message with mutt (or any external application that can open an mbox)
 * More proper UTF-8 handling
 * Configurable key mappings
 * Much simpler, cleaner, beautiful, and extensible code (only 600 lines!)

== install ==

=== ruby bindings ===

Go to notmuch source code, and then 'bindings/ruby':

 % ruby extconf.rb
 % make
 % sudo make install

If you have installed libnotmuch in a non-standard location, you might want to
add a few flags, so you don't have to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH all the time.

 % make LOCAL_LIBS='-Wl,--enable-new-dtags -Wl,-rpath,/opt/notmuch/lib'

If you don't want to mess with you system, you can just copy the .so file to
any place you want, but make sure you export the RUBYLIB variable to point
there.

You should now be able to run

 % ruby -e "require 'notmuch'"

cleanly. If you don't see any errors, it means it's working :)

=== mail gem ===

Since libnotmuch library concentrates on things other than handling mail, we
need a library to do that, and for Ruby the best library for that is called
'mail'. The easiest way to install it is with ruby's gem. In most distro's the
package is called 'rubygems'.

Once you have gem, run:

 % gem install mail

In some systems gems are installed on a per-user basis by default, so make sure
you are running as the same user as the one that installed them.

=== actual vim plugin ===

You first need to install the original vim plugin, or at least have the syntax
files available:

 ~/.vim/syntax/notmuch-{compose,folders,git-diff,search,show}.vim

If you have the notmuch source code available, just go to the 'vim' directory
and type 'make install' (make sure you create the missing directories if the
build complains).

Then just copy notmuch-ruby.vim to ~/.vim/plugins/notmuch-ruby.vim.

You can grab it from here:
https://raw.github.com/felipec/notmuch-vim-ruby/master/notmuch-ruby.vim

Before firing it up, there's only one configuration that is absolutely needed; the location of your desired database.

So add something like this in your .vimrc:

 let g:notmuch_rb_database = '/home/felipec/mail'

You can check the actual path in your '~/.notmuch-config'

That's it just, fire it up!

 % gvim -c ':NotMuchR'

Enjoy ;)

== More stuff ==

As an example to configure a key mapping to add the tag 'to-do' and archive,
this is what I use:

let g:notmuch_rb_custom_search_maps = {
	\ 't':		'search_tag("+to-do -inbox")',
	\ }

let g:notmuch_rb_custom_show_maps = {
	\ 't':		'show_tag("+to-do -inbox")',
	\ }
